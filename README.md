##  Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning solution to predict customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. By identifying customers who are likely to discontinue their service, the company can proactively implement retention strategies to mitigate revenue loss and enhance customer satisfaction.

**Business Problem**: Customer churn poses a significant challenge in the telecommunications industry, where acquiring new customers is considerably more expensive than retaining existing ones. SyriaTel needs to address this issue effectively.

**Technical Objective**: The goal is to create a binary classification model that accurately predicts which customers are likely to churn based on their usage patterns, service history, and demographic information. The model should prioritize:

- **High recall** to capture the majority of churning customers
- **Balanced precision** to minimize excessive false positives
- **Interpretability** to provide actionable business insights

##  Dataset Description

The analysis utilizes telecommunications customer data that includes:
- **Customer demographics** and account information
- **Service usage patterns** (calls, minutes, charges across different time periods)
- **Plan features** and service options
- **Customer service interactions**
- **Target variable**: A binary churn indicator (churned/not churned)

##  Data Science Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Exploration
- **Initial Assessment**: Evaluate dataset structure, identify missing values, and review basic statistics.
- **Target Analysis**: Analyze churn distribution and assess class imbalance.
- **Feature Analysis**: Differentiate between numerical and categorical variables.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate relationships between features.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examine feature distributions based on churn status.
- **Categorical Analysis**: Perform cross-tabulation of categorical features with churn.
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identify key indicators of customer churn.

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- **New Feature Creation**: 
  - Calculate average call duration metrics.
  - Aggregate total usage across time periods.
  - Develop usage intensity indicators.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Apply label encoding for categorical variables.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Address data types and handle missing values.

### 4️⃣ Feature Selection
- **Statistical Selection**: Utilize F-scores to identify top predictive features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Select the most relevant features for modeling.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determine which factors drive churn.

### 5️⃣ Model Development & Evaluation
- **Multiple Algorithm Testing**:
  - Logistic Regression (with scaling)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement 5-fold stratified cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Assess ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

### 6️⃣ Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct grid search optimization for the best-performing model.
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluate improvements resulting from tuning.
- **Final Model Selection**: Choose the optimal model configuration.

### 7️⃣ Business Impact Analysis
- **Confusion Matrix Interpretation**: Analyze true/false positives and negatives.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Assess the business impact of model predictions.
- **Actionable Insights**: Translate model results into practical business recommendations.

##  Model Interpretability

The model provides insights into:
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which customer characteristics most strongly predict churn.
- **Risk Segmentation**: Categorizing customers by churn probability.
- **Business Drivers**: Understanding the root causes of customer churn.
- **Intervention Points**: Determining when and how to implement retention strategies.

##  Model Performance

The final model achieves:
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Indicates the overall discrimination ability of the model.
- **Precision**: The percentage of predicted churners who actually churn.
- **Recall**: The percentage of actual churners correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: A balanced measure of precision and recall.

*Specific performance metrics will be displayed upon executing the complete pipeline.*

##  Business Recommendations

Based on the model results, the following strategies are recommended:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Target High-Risk Customers**: Concentrate retention efforts on customers identified by the model.
2. **Proactive Outreach**: Reach out to customers with a high churn probability before they leave.
3. **Personalized Offers**: Design retention campaigns tailored to key churn factors.
